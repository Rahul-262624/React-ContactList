## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 🧾 Prerequisites
- Node.js ≥ 18  
- Supabase account (https://supabase.com)  
- Vercel or Netlify account (for deployment)

---

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tria-contact-list.git
cd tria-contact-list
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3️⃣ Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

You can find these values in your Supabase dashboard under  
**Project Settings → API → Project URL / anon public key**.

---

## 🧰 Supabase Setup Guide

### 1️⃣ Create a New Supabase Project
- Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com).  
- Create a new project and note your project URL and anon key.

### 2️⃣ Create the Contacts Table
You can use the migration file provided in your repo:  
`/supabase/migrations/20251024164822_create_contacts_table.sql`

SQL content example:
```sql
create table contacts (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  name text not null,
  phone text,
  email text,
  created_at timestamp default now()
);
```

Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor or CLI.

### 3️⃣ (Optional) Remove Auth Dependency
If you want open access for demo purposes, run the second migration:  
`/supabase/migrations/20251024165219_remove_auth_from_contacts.sql`

This removes the auth dependency from the contacts table (useful for testing).

### 4️⃣ Test Your Connection
Once your `.env` file is set, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
You should see your contacts list appear at **http://localhost:5173**

## 🏗️ Build & Deployment

To create an optimized production build:
```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be in the `/dist` folder.  
Deploy this folder to **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or any static host:

```bash
vercel deploy
```

---

## 🧠 Design & Implementation Notes

- The app uses **React Hooks** for state and side effects.  
- Contact search is case-insensitive and runs locally for instant response.  
- Tailwind provides a minimal, clean design system without external UI libraries.  
- No Redux or heavy state management — simplicity preferred.  
- Error and empty states are clearly indicated for good UX.

---

## 💡 Assumptions

- Contacts are stored in a public Supabase table (for demo simplicity).  
- Authentication and pagination are out of scope for this assignment.  
- The app prioritizes clarity and responsiveness over advanced animations.

---

## 🤖 AI Usage Disclosure

AI tools (like ChatGPT) were used for:
- Boilerplate scaffolding (React + Vite setup)
- Documentation drafting (README and setup guides)
- Styling inspiration (Tailwind component ideas)

All final logic, structure, and testing were completed manually and reviewed for correctness.
